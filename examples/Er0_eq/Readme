The switch of the electric field calculation is 'iterative_phi0'. You can search this word in the code.

The RF sheath boundary condition on the limiter surface at outer-middle plane is applied by this sentence:
    "ddt(U00) = -(B0/(eta_sh*sbc_lambda1))*Grad2_par2_sh(phi01,phish1)"
    The 'phish1' is the RF sheath. In the function 'Grad2_par2_sh', when doing the parallel derivative in SOL (Normalized Psi>1), the 'phish1' is used. 

The thermal sheath boundary condition is applied on the divertor surface by the sentence:
    "SBC_Dirichlet(phi01, phish0);"
    The 'phish0' is applied in the poloidal guide cell from inner to outer radial boundary.
