A "dead-start" is a Corsica session where an equilibrium is establised without
a previously saved solution (i.e., from a save-file).

This directory contains two input files for an early version of FDF[1]:

	tokamak.inp  : Plasma parameters & grid specification
	coils.inp    : PF coil specifications

The Corsica standard script file 'tokamak.bas' contains a dead-start procedure
which reads these files (and others, if available) to produce a "starting-
point" equilibrium which will be preserved in a save-file. Preparation of the
input files for the dead-start procedure and usage examples are described in
the document "Creating Tokamak Equilibria with Corsica"[2].

Briefly, start-up the code *without* a save-file and read the tokamak.bas
script file:

	caltrans tokamak.bas

Execute the 'tokamak_ds' procedure (or its synonym, 'ds') with one or both
intput files:

	ds("tokamak.inp")  # PF coils will be automatically generated

or:

	ds("tokamak.inp", "coils.inp")  # Use coil set in coils.inp file

A new save-file will be created at the end of the dead-start procedure. It will
be the starting point for refinements to the equilibrium and/or the device
configuration.

Execute the two demo scripts in this directory:

	caltrans -probname fdf2 demo1.bas

	caltrans fdf2.sav demo2.bas
