Simulate the tri-diagonal matrix algorithm implemented in BOUT++ matrix inversion. 
In this, information is passed around a la serial mode to each row in order to convert to an upper triangular matrix.
Therefore, each successive core has to wait for information from the previous, and therefore remains idle until that information arrives.

Solve for u in the equation 

d^2 u/dx^2 = -1

with BCs

u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0. 

The solution to this equation is u= 1/2(x-x^2) with the maximum y(x=1/2) = 1/8.

Use second order central difference scheme to discretize.

After discretizing, we get 

u_{i+1} - 2 u_i +u_{i+1} = h^2 f (where f=-1, and h=1/N is the grid spacing, with N+1 grid points).

Thus, the tridiagonal system 

a_i u_{i-1} + b_i u_i +c_i u_{i+1} = f_i 

is to be inverted. For the TDMA or Thomas algorithm, we eliminate a_i for a given row by doing a row operation

A=(-2 1 
      1 -2 1
	 ....
		-2 1)

Get rid of a_i as follows

Define R_n-> R_n - R_{n-1} *a_n/b_{n-1} 

We will then get 

A=(-2 1
      ....
	0 b_n c_n
		....
		   b_N) 

Now proceed backwards. First solve for u_N = f_N/b_N. Now we can backsubstitute for u_{n+1} in 
	
b_n u_n +c_n u_{n+1} = f_n

or u_n = (f_n - c_n u_{n+1})/b_n
